The Udo Udo Kruschwitz - Research Information Research Interests I am a Senior Lecturer and a member of the Language and Computation Group here at Essex . My research interests are in natural language processing , information retrieval and the implementation of such techniques in real applications. The intelligent directory enquiry assistant project is an example where the extraction of information from partially structured data together with engineering issues played major roles in making the YPA a usable online system.  I am developing techniques that allow the extraction of conceptual information from document collections and the utilization of such knowledge in retrieval tasks. The type of documents can range from Web pages to newspaper articles or other forms of vaguely/partially structured data. You can see these methods in action by trying out the University of Essex search engine We are also exploring how to implement and use such techniques in future intelligent home environments. This work is carried out as part of the research in the Digital Lifestyles Centre here at Essex. Current Projects A new Knowledge Transfer Partnership project involving the MBS Group and us has just kicked off. I am pleased that Miguel Martinez-Alvarez has joined us to work on this project as a KTP Associate! PEBL-AI is a new project that will follow on from the Patient Experience and Public Engagement Blogs project. PEBL-AI will result in an automated interface between clinical commissioner groups and the communities they serve. More to follow ... Automatic Adaptation of Knowledge Structures for Assisted Information Seeking , a project involving the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Robert Gordon University Aberdeen and the Open University. This project aims to develop and evaluate methods for adapting automatically constructed domain models to the population of users' search or browsing behaviour. Application and large-scale evaluation of the developed methods in two information seeking scenarios - namely, interactive search and browsing - will be performed on a number of domains.   Creating anaphorically annotated resources through semantic wikis This project has led to the development of Phrase Detectives, an annotation game aimed at the creation of semantically annotated corpora: Recent Research/Development Projects Development of a career path framework, a project involving the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering and JobServe, the world's first Internet Recruitment Service. Development of an intelligent mail server, a project involving the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering and Active Web Solutions , an Ipswich based company devoted to cutting edge enterprise information systems.
